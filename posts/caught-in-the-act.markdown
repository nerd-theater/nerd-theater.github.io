<b>DancinPete</b>: Don't worry little Michael, you'll get a real elephant some day!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Will his name be Babar?<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: P.S. There's an apostrophe designating possession that is not doing its job! <br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: What apostrophe?<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Hint: it should make its grand appearance in the second frame. <br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Really? "Banned from TheWebComicList.com"? <br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Yes, Mike got his'sef banned by being an asshole and starting a huge fight. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Fuck you, you goddamned Cornish jew-raping sack of dead baby shit. They started it.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Whoa, whoa, whoa! One at a time, ladies! And do tell. Ah do like me some good gossip wit' mah collard greens.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I merely pointed out to the WebComicList.com forum admin that (A) all British people are fags, (B) she was probably a fat dude, and (C) if B was not the case, she should post naked pics. And then she banned me! WTF?<br /><br />
<b>alex</b>: While Mike WAS being an asshole and starting a fight, in his defense the people on that forum are a bunch of cock suckers. They think that web comics are "art" and that it's real serious stuff to publish a FREE webcomic.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Yeah, the (defunct) comic I found listed on that website about a dude and his dog outside of a caf√© represent art in its purest form. Those guys can go suck a big elephant tit. Are there other websites that would help you get your name out there? Surely that cannot be the only one. <br /><br />
<b>alex</b>: it's not the only one, but it's probably the biggest and they all seem to be full of ass holes.<br /><br />
