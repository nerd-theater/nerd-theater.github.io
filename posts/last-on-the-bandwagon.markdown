<b>Dancinpete</b>: Would it be instant or drip coffee?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Trash coffee. We would scrounge through refuse in order to recover sufficient quantities of richer folks' coffee-laden spittle.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I must know... In the last frame...is that turd under your toupee?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: It's supposed to be blood, but now that you mention it...<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Oh. ... Oh! You...you're doin' good.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Fixed it. Who says great art can't change?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I hope the turd under your ego isn't too bruised!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Fungus</b>: Panel One: The hero of the comic breaks (?) a bar of soap. This is the source of humor.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Fungus</b>: Panel Two: Mike (with the M shirt) speaks to Alex (with the A shirt) and says "you poor ignorant fool" which is funny.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Fungus</b>: Panel Three: Violence.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Astute observations there, Fungus! If you join our Nerd Theater Summer Internship program, Alex promises to only molest you sporadically (when not intoxicated).<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I hope Fungus continues to explain all of your comics panel by panel. It's so enriching. <br /><br />
