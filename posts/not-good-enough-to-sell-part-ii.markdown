<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: tattoo hell, I'll brand myself with this shit<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I would also brand you with this shit.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Alex has captured Michael's true essence here: Michael always tends to clutch his tummy whenever he laughs heartily. Sometimes he farts a little, but I see Alex has been kind in omitting the fart lines from the comic.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Thank you DP, I personally thought that my comic version of mike got his essense, if not his strict form.<br /><br />
