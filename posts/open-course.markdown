<b>Michelle</b>: A leopard wouldn't have consumed your colon. A leopard would have just snapped your neck and dragged you up into a tree to eat at a later time, but at least it wouldn't start from the colon up!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I think a leopard would consider starting with the colon if it had to listen to a crusty old man in a turtle-neck say the word "innovation" one more time!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: No, the leopard would probably ignore the crusty old man in the turtle-neck because he is a vegan and is too sinewy and gross. The pot-bellied buffoon who feeds on the flesh of lesser beasts would definitely be more appealing. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: And who exactly is this "pot-bellied buffoon"?<br /><br />
<b>Jinksy</b>: heh?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Y'know... just, uh... sayin' stuff... 'n junk...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I guess in the end we can all agree that Macs are totally gay :)<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I worked on your dads Suburban, heard about your car<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Fords are teh suxzor<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Also, did you think of this comic during a meeting on campus about Ubuntu?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: No, everyone's a Mac user in my lab.  Mostly because the boss is a Mac user.<br /><br />
