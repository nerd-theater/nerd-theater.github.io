<b>Alex</b>: This here is "high concept"<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: This is totally how texting will work in a few years<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Alan put in so much effort for a well-known fact! He must have spent all of his month's milk money to make sure you received the letter on the same rainy night!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Horse couriers really make you "pony up" the dough, eh?  EH?!?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Speaking from experience, Mikey?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: "Donkey Show" is actually olde english for "Mike takes it in the pooper." So yea, he has ungulate experience.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: ...from a donkey?  Wouldn't that impale me?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I don't know, I throw up just thinking about your and a donkey.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I guess I'll just cancel your gift subscription to www.mikeandthedonkey.com then...happy birthday, asshole<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Whoa, that would explain why Michael's name is second on the list of those who suffer from "Rectus Gigantimus." You would think with all the equine action of which Michael boasts, he would be farther up on the list, but there is no competing with Paris Hilton. Sorry, buddy! Maybe next year?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Paris Hilton can't compete with me. I once swallowed a whole human with my anus. <br /><br />
<b>True Mike</b>: Yup<br /><br />
<b>The Real Mike</b>: Slander! I do ass-kegel exercises with my anus on a daily basis! I may have my a-hole pummeled on an almost hourly rate, but it is still as tight and firm as the first time I turned a SNES controller sideways and crammed it up my shitter!<br /><br />
<b>YogiB</b>: GROSS!!<br /><br />
<b>YogiB</b>: Michael, I hereby sentence you life long imprisonment for torturing a Donkey by getting sexual favours in exchange for junk mail coupons!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I pay the donkey for the sex! I AM SICK OFF ALL THESE LIES!<br /><br />
<b>Mike Fo' Real Y'all</b>: I think the comments have slightly derailed here.  I don't want to point fingers, but THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT MICHELLE!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Did someone say railed? Can dudes get railed here?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Another symptom of "Rectus Gigantus" is blaming innocent people for the vortex that is your ever-expanding donkey disco stick lovin' bum! <br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Er... "Rectus Gigantimus". Sometimes memory loss is a side-effect of coming in contact with someone who is suffering from "Rectus Gigantimus".<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I enjoy consuming feces for nickels.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: It does'nt work like that Mike, cause everyone knows you love cock. My love for poo is un-heard of. <br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Now the world knows that I eat poo and smoke pole.  Yippie!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: The world has known for years about my swollen and misshapen colon<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: The pictures for my colon have been up on goatse.cx for years...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I wish people would look closer at that picture and figure out it's me. :( <br /><br />
<b>The Lord Jebus</b>: Y'all er goin' to hell.<br /><br />
<b>The real Jebus</b>: What he said, fellers. <br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/3801177.stm<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: For those who don't copy-and-paste, the article is about a man who beats a horse in a race...LIES!!!!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Yeah, I'm definitely not copying-and-pasting anything that is posted on a site that exploits wayward men who fancy horse peen. Nope, nothin' doin'!<br /><br />
<b>Horse</b>: (0)(0)================|)&gt;<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: You know if you keep catering to horses, you're going to lose your goat demographic. Now is not the time to be losing your fan base!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: We're showing high numbers in young male goats across the board, thank you very much!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Of course it would be male goats...<br /><br />
