<b>Alex</b>: Suck it Rustmonster.<br /><br />
<b>ilovepancakes</b>: I guess when you guys seek constructive criticism, you'll have a fun time weeding out those animal rape porn loving Douchie McDouchersons. Best of luck...<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: No, we won't weed anything out. Bring the pain. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: People can say what they want. Notice the lack of Google ads and such on this site? We LOSE money making Nerd Theater because we LIKE doing it. We don't need people to tell us we're awesome, we know it already.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Poor Charlie  Brown. :-(  Where's his kite now?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: The truth is comics like Peanuts and Calvin &amp; Hobs are what inspires us, probably more than modern web comics. Though me cooking Chuckles is kinda cold. <br /><br />
