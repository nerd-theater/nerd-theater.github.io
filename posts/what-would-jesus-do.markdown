<em>I think the Gospel where Jesus goes to Splash Mountain is in the Book of Mormon.</em>

<b>Dancinpete</b>: Jesus goes to Splash Mountain according to the Book of Mormon? Whoa! To think, you could have learned this years ago if your copy had never been stolen and set on fire!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I think I actually did give Mike a book of mormon once. I'm pretty sure my aunt gave it to me, and Mike was real interested in religion at the time.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I had heard the Book contained a plethora of anachronisms, and I wanted to investigate. Sadly, it was snatched by someone who deemed it was a "bad thing" for me and set ablaze. Nowadays, I just don't care to investigate.<br /><br />
