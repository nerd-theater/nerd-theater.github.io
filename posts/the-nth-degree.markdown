<b>Mike</b>: True dat, bra<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: they are!<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I think it would help you build character. Lord knows you need it with that stench that emanates from your every pore.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: And you think the stench would go DOWN by working fast food?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Well, no, but at least you would have some character to make up for your EMANATING STENCH! Duh, Becky!<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: No, the real reason for getting fired is the voluntary inoculation of stench cells into food which is ironical since any fast food is crap which makes it worse than stench and hence does not deserve any disciplinary action.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: ...what the bloody hell are you talking about, DIL?<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: You are in it, you will not understand, such is the nature of the SYSTEM!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: In a nutshell, you stink like dirty nappies, Mike.<br /><br />
