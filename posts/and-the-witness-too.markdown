<b>Michelle</b>: Did you HAVE to set the little teddy bear on fire, too?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: He knew too much!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Is that a paddle ball?<br /><br />
<b>jinksy</b>: for some reason this is seems oddly familiar...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That's the mouse, not a paddle ball<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: That looks like my bosses F-150 pickup<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Sweet!  I used images of an F-150 pickup as my model.  For the woman, I used images of YOUR MOM.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: And the bear? What about the bear?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: do you think my mom is pretty?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I used Alex's mom for the bear too.  She's one hot bear.<br /><br />
<b>The Goat</b>: How about the guy in green ? I think he should jump too. One can never believe oneself to be confidential..<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I think he plans to get a sex change, move to Norway, and start a punk rock group for teens.<br /><br />
<b>A</b>: anyone who doesn't kill unnecessary processes...shouldn't get the internet for 2 weeks...*soup nazi voice* "no internet for you !"<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Agreed!  And the same for anyone who doesn't plug a broken external drive into their wife's PC and have it explode.<br /><br />
