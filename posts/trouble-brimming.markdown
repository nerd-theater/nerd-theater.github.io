<b>Dancinpete</b>: Of course it was about some dude's peen...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Some guy? SOME GUY?!? Peter North moves for no man!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: See, in my head we were arguing about something like how to calculate the volume of a cylinder, but you wanted to know the volume of Peter Norths cylinder<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: His penis is not a straight-up cylinder, so the traditional "area of base times height" formula is a poor approximation. With a proper girth function in hand, though, we could use calculus to integrate over length to obtain volume.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Ewies.<br /><br />
