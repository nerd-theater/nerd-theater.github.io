<b>Mike</b>: I love how he's got all of his game pieces at the table.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: So I take it Alan is never playing Settlers with you again?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: We haven't played since.  I doubt he would trust me if we did though.  TAKE ME BACK, ALAN!  I'VE CHANGED!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Alan is the master of duplicitous Settlers play. Never, NEVER EVER trust Alan in a game of Settlers. <br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I always warn people and they never listen. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: He's also the master at rallying everyone else against you just because you robbed him of brick and probably raped his settlers<br /><br />
