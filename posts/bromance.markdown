<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: MAMAMAA!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Who's house are you in and why is that dreadful poster on the wall?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: There are kids in Uganda who would LOVE a poster of screaming vaginae on their wall!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: OMG! That poster has to be our first merch item!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: next i hear there are going to be plush toys....<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Everyone realizes the plush toys won't be "fully functional", right?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: That will be a popular mod<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Oh, god, why didn't you tell me I misused an apostrophe? It is just as bad as those fleeing vaginas. They look so scared. Especially the African American vagina.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: How do you know the dark-skinned vagina is necessarily an American of African descent?  She could be Latina!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: If it's brown, drink it down!<br /><br />
