<b>Michelle</b>: Gross, Michael!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Yay, a comment!  It worked :)<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: That is fucking brilliant. <br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Of course Alan has an Old Tyme pistol...<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Sadly, Alan does in fact own a couple of old pistols. They were his grandfathers and one is the classic old .32 special with the breakway chamber design.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: So what you're saying is: Alan's grandfather wanted me dead.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Actually, I don't think your little plan worked, because I always comment!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: But you need to recruit!  What about all those French people you can converse with now?  Ask them to find some cool people to visit our site.<br /><br />
<b>The Truthman</b>: This is what you get for saying wrong things like goats eat alumin(i)um!!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Write more comics about buck futting and your French representation will go up ten-fold!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: And goats do too eat aluminumium!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Michelle: Buck-futting?  Sorry, but we have *standards* on this site.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: We do, where? Where are these standards! DASH THEM UPON THE ROCKS, THE DIRTY SCOUNDRALS!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Alex: Didn't we vote you president of the Nerd Theater Standards Committee after Alan insisted on doing ten comics in a row on the decline of post-1950's society?<br /><br />
