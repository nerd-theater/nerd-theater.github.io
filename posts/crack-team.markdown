<b>Mike</b>: Perfect!  ...what do you suppose is in Alex's brown paper bag?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I'm going to go ahead and guess that it's Alex's poo<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Condoms, cause that skank D.A. been round the block, if you get me<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: You need an entire bag's worth?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I got a big dick, what can I say?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm fairly certain that a penis whose size truly necessitated a brown-bag-sized condom would capture one's body's entire blood supply during an erection, thus killing its host.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: That is because you have a small penis, and doubt both my girth and my stamina. Fag. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Why do all of our conversations end with you extolling the girth of your cock?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Because you are fascinated with my big dick, you queerdo. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: If I'm so fascinated with your dick, why did I compress my digital pictures of it to JPEG and delete the originals; thus introducing an unrecoverable loss of quality?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Because you thought if you used a crappy image format your crappy old iPod might be willing to show pictures, so you could jack off in the bathroom everytime you went for a pee break.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: But, Michael... why did you have photos of it in the first place?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I don't think I understand the question.<br /><br />
