<b>Alex</b>: I'm kind of scared that mike always draws us in our robes hanging out<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That's just what guys do, silly!  They hang out in their robes and have sexy-fun bath oil fights in the shower :P<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: That reply explains so much.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Nerd Theater now has a mobile site at nerdtheater.com/m<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Also, I'm not gay.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Remember folks, defending his sexuality always comes after the tech stuff. Cause he's gay. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: You can't prove that beyond a 99.99% probability<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Alex, your gayness defeats the basic tenents of science, you are actually 111% gay, which also happens to be the gayest percentage. They call it "Mike percent."<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Why did you address yourself?  Freudian slip perhaps?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Have you no shame, leaving your good for nothing pills just laying about? Talk about lawsuit waiting to happen!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Good for nothing pills?!?  That, madam, is grounds for a lawsuit!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Do your worst!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Go to minecraft.com and join our server! Free ops for friends and family of nerdtheatre.com!<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Is that Alan's face on the back of The News? Poor guy... doesn't even know he's missing!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Yay! There are hidden messages in every comic if you look close enough...<br /><br />
