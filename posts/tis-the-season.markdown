<b>DIL</b>: Why is a portion of the grass or the pavement not seen through the GAPING hole where the man's heart is supposed to be?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Jeebus healed him.<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: I am seeing more every time I look at this strip. I see that there is a lot of Force/Pressure being applied at the heart, but  HOW THE HELL did Mike catch that heart after such an impact with his hand already stuck inside the other man's chest?<br /><br />
