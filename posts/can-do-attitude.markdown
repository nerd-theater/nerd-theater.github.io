<b>Michelle</b>: My, what a generous bulge you have bequeathed upon your soup f-er.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: He stuffs.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I'm running out of things to say. <br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Okay, WHY is there a guy f-ing cans of soup in a soup factory? Where did he come from?<br /><br />

<b>Alex</b>: I am so sad that our comic rides on the wings of masturbation/ soup jokes<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I curtail to the needs of our biggest fans.<br /><br />
