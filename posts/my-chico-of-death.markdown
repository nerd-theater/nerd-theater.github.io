<b>Mike</b>: The top Google search for this month that has brought people to Nerd Theater is "dildo ball". Do we win the internets?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: ... Congratulations? <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Good evening, sir. Did you come here looking for a dildo ball?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I typed in "Proof that Mike is a homo ungulate," and this site was top of the list. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: You've made a powerful enemy today.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: What are you going to do? Wave your little ungulate hooves at me?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I will swing around wildly in a circle and use my ungulate rear-end to fling poo on you.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Is that an even or odd-toed ungulate rear end? ... You know what? I don't want to know.<br /><br />
