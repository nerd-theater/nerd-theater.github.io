<b>Jesus H. Christ</b>: He started it!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I still don't really understand this one.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: This is another one of Alan's brilliant, yet under-appreciated scripts.  I love it, but no one else seems to get it.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: It probably doesn't help that the first comic about this was like 6 months ago. Or that Alan took this from weird old testament stuff. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That's why I added the nifty "Related to" drop-down in the top-right!  Also, it's *technically* New Testament, not Old.  You know, the whole Jewish Messiah thing.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I bet our legion of fan can't wait for our masterpiece about Job and the pillar of salt. (oops, spoilers!)<br /><br />
<b>Alan</b>:  Actually, Mike wrote the first one, but he's too embarrassed to take credit.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: THROW YOURSELF INTO THE SEA, ALAN!!!<br /><br />
<b>ALAN</b>: CAPS ARE YELLING MIKE! DON'T YELL AT ME FUCKER!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS FIGHTING! *sobs*<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: See what you've done, Alan?  You woke up little Alex!  Go back to bed, honey...everything's fine *sob*<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Quit fighting and just get to the make up sex already!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I don't know...Alan always makes me tell him I love him first.<br /><br />
<b>Hesoos</b>: Why are the two sidekicks giving Jesus a boob squeeze ?!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Yeah, Michael, what's up with that? Just because you'd enjoy to be taken from behind by two hirsute, purple-nurple bequeathing men doesn't mean Jesus appreciated it!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: What are you talking about?  Jesus INVENTED the boob-squeeze AND the reach-around!<br /><br />
<b>Hesoos</b>: YES! But not to be performed on him.. Geez, show some respect for the creator for my sake!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Hesoos: I think you want us all to back off so you and you alone can squeeze Jesus' boobs.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Are we going to hell for htis string of comments?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Alex: Doubtful.  I'm pretty sure Jesus was just some homeless guy with schizophrenia.<br /><br />
