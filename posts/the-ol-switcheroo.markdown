<b>Alex</b>: I am grossed out, but glad I'm not the one getting fucked by a female version of my roomate.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Whoa!  Those bots are just escorts.  Anything that happens outside of a nice meal and a pleasant conversation is none of your business, right?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: I cannot get over how disturbing this is. The ideas that run through your head... * shudders *<br /><br />
<b>ALEX</b>: I'M IN THE STARCRAFT 2 BETA! STARCRAFT 2! OVER TEN YEARS OF WAITING AND THEY CHOSE ME! OH HAPPY DAY, OH HAPPY MOTHERFUCKING DAY!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: LIES!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I'll take the doctor<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Be careful.  I hear his exams leave *nothing* to the imagination.<br /><br />
