<b>Eric</b>: This is how Swine Flu *really* got its start in this gullible little world of ours.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I would like to take this opportunity to announce that I am gay.<br /><br />
<b>Sassy McGee</b>: Wherre do you get this Shit?<br /><br />
<b>Jinksy</b>: The art is cooool!!!<br /><br />
<b>The Real Mike</b>: Alan wishes I was gay, so he'd have someone to go with him to his FOOTBALL PARTIES ON SATURDAY NIGHTS WITH THE GUYS.<br /><br />
<b>Alan</b>: Jinksy lies.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Wow, I missed some stuff during my sojourn. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: You didn't miss much.  Nerd Theater became a multi-million dollar success, but we lost it all in legal fees when Alan made racist comments against Whites during the press conference.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: The karaoke guy had it coming for singing that abortion of a song. He should have totally done Peaches' "F*** the Pain Away." Maybe the audience wouldn't have been as eager to paint the karaoke bar with his entrails, swine flu infested or not.<br /><br />
<b>70's Dude</b>: "Come on baby, can you do more than dance?"  ROCK ON!!!!<br /><br />
<b>Jinksy</b>: Yeah but I was tryin to be nice and all.  Now you've runined it.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Jinksy: So the art's...NOT cooool?  *sob*<br /><br />
