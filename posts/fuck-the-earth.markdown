<b>Alan</b>: I feel ya,<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Maybe you need to put streamers on the handlebars?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Yes, I'm sure that would significantly decrease the ridicule.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: OR, you could simply quit fooling yourself and buy a damned Mac already. The Mac community would embrace you, Michael. Come, come into the light!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: NEVER!  I would rather be scorched by the heat of a 1000 suns!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Well said crap-book hater !<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Yeah, because those douchebags on campus NEVER have a Dell because they had to leave it in the freezer due to overheating.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: What does that mean? Do PC's over heat? Do Mac's not make heat? Do they not make heat because they never do anything besides iTunes, WoW and shemale rape porn?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: There's no way ANY device can play shemale rape porn without producing heat; it's against the laws of thermogaynamics.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: WTF is shemale rape porn?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Ummmm...I'll tell you when you're older.  WAAAY older.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: If it is anything like hello.JPEG, then perhaps it is best we talk about other things... like, fluffy kittens, dandelions... bumblebees!<br /><br />
