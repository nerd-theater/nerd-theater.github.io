<b>Alex</b>: Ha! It's XKCD. Not as biting as I thought it would be though. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I decided to go less biting and more poop joke.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Why "nerd-theater.com" instead of "nerdtheater.com"? We just printed t-shirts and magnets! THINK OF THE CHILDREN!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: A sequence of unfortunate technical events has led to the move. We ask all readers to update their magnets, t-shirts, and tattoos.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: There is plenty of room (and by plenty, I mean a generous amount... and by generous amount, I mean you could add 523 hyphens and still have room to spare) to insert a hyphen on your buttcheek tattoo, so I suppose there is no need to panic.<br /><br />
<b>Captain Hott</b>: BURN!<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: You mean I've been falsely advertising in my shirt, all over town? HOW DARE YOU, SIR<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: It's not like that, see! We're still buds, right?<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: ...probationary buds, I suppose. But you watch your step!<br /><br />
