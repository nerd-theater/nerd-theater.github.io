<b>DIL</b>: That is hilarious! It is always severly funny either when one is pointing out mistakes that are inferior compared to the gravity of the current situation or when heavy usage of expletives is employed!<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: I like attention to finer detail like ACME brand soup can. Although, should Alex have seen enough cartoons, he should have stayed away from them since they have a tendency to always affect the primary user<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: Alex looks like Calvin in the last frame! Also, how bad was the can, he seems to be wearing shoes?!<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I love this comic for too many reasons: the rubber ducky, the fact that a) Michael is in the OR and b) that Michael didn't even bother to change out of his gross, crusty, unwashed bathrobe, but put on a face mask nonetheless...Oh, and I love the sheer hilarity, of course. P.S. Maybe this will learn Alex to not purchase soup cans that have been f*&amp;#ed by some undersexed tubster of a middle-aged trainwreck.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I...I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, so I'm going to believe you agree that I'm awesome!<br /><br />
<b>Snow</b>: Loved the Charlie Brown face on the last slide. I secretly was hoping it was a coincidence until I learned the truth...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Every pixel of Nerd Theater has meaning. See that blue one up there to the left? It's for the Holocaust.<br /><br />
<b>ALEX</b>: DID YOU GO TO ART SCHOOL? HUH MUTHERFUCKER? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THAT BLUE MEANS! YOU CAN'T BE GOOD AT EVERYTHING!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I didn't need to go to art school. I already had talent.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: DPS talents<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Please, enlighten the world about what "DPS" means.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Dicks Per Second. Mike is the one that took international dick sucking competition from the DPM, or "Dicks Per Minute" to the DPS, adding a whole new level of competition. <br /><br />
