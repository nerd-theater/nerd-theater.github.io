<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I like how Luigi's hat cleverly obscures the princesses shirt to avoid any extra illustration. It also looks like it's got some magic blurring effect too. Plus what the hell happened to the princesses hands?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: fuck, i know nothing about possessives. kill me now.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Regarding Luigi's head placement, I'm even lazier than you suspect: the Princess picture in the 2nd panel is a direct copy from the 1st panel with a blur effect added.  Hooray for copy/paste!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Oh, and Bowser ate her hand and foot...some kind of fetish thing, I guess.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: ...and she bothered to put them back in the shackles?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Sadism is some nasty stuff. Bowser needs a new hobby.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Bowser doesn't have time for a new hobby!  Between eating royal limbs and molesting Toad, he's got his claws full.<br /><br />
