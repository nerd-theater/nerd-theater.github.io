<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: the bunny slippers are adorable<br /><br />
<b>Rallo</b>: Besides bunnies, I'd say my biggest fears are water and Republicans.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Love the grape soda!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm totally going to hell.  If not for this, then for my attempts to breed goats and homeless people.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: It all makes so much sense now. When you tell your wife you are going for an 'evening run,' it was just a euphemism for 'breeding goats and homeless people'?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: It's no lie, since I often have to chase down the goats!  I can tie up the homeless people, but the goats keep chewing through the ropes :(<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: What about tin cans? Do they chew through tin cans?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Goats will eat anything, including your soul.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Apparently not! http://faithfulfarm.net/faq.shtml#6<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: I love how on their banner, they have a Bible verse, which is supposed to justify the amazingness of goats.<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: I think everyone's missing the point here, which should CLEARLY be anticipation for a new master race! I'm thinking "Gobos", or maybe "Hoboats".<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Emmet, I think that's the best idea you've had since the narwhal report!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: There's only one thing to do - learn the language of the goats, earn their trust, and breed with their women. And in time, our differences will be forgotten.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Yeah, run that brilliant idea by your WIFE and see what she has to say!<br /><br />
