<b>DIL</b>: I like how the placement of Alex in the middle introduces a whole new dimension to the gravity of the situation compensating the absence of a chronological order<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Oh, dear god!!!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: We aim to please here at Nerd Theater. Enjoy, ladies!<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I think you should know that I am also creeped out by Alex's navel. At first glance, I thought it was something else and almost, ALMOST thought my Nerd Theatre viewing days were coming to an end.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: For those who wonder, I did not actually draw Alex's genitalia behind the towel. <br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: That's why the proportion never comes out right. If you're not drawing people naked first then you're not drawing. <br /><br />
<b>Alex's Wiener</b>: The proportion looks right to me. I'm microscopic and usually quite flaccid.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Quite yapping about your wieners and just DO IT ALREADY.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: And just so you know, in Vatican City, which is where I'm from, we say "Quite" to mean "Quit".<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I think this comic accurately depicts the not-so-surprising lack of Alex's wang.<br /><br />
