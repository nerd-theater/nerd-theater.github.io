<b>Alex</b>: Note to readers: This is NOT how Mike got married. This is, though, he he found out he fucking LOVES trannies.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Well sure, if you define trannie as "a male or female who feels they were born the wrong gender and may seek sexual reassignment surgery", then who doesn't?<br /><br />
<b>Dawginlaw</b>: Hey, isn't that the dude that sold his ho of a wife to the colonial american in the background? How the hell did she grow the lower half of her body again?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: He's selling his wife, again???<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: No!  It's a different perspective on the original "situation".  You can't regrow the lower half of your body, sillies!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Ohhh... so that's how he won the popular vote. And all this time I thought it was because of that silly hat!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Suck my nuts dry, you god-damned spam bots.  We have comment captchas now, thanks to you.  I'll see you in the lowest levels of hell!<br /><br />
<b>MikeEatsChimpanzees</b>: BUCKFUTTER!<br /><br />
<b>ChimpanzeesEatMike</b>: BUCKFUTTER!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Back Scratcher\<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Banana hammock!<br /><br />
<b>Dawginlaw</b>: Wait!! That dude in the blue shirt did sell his HO again!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Michael! What the hell are you doing boozing it up in a bar grabbing the boobs of some other chick?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: "When boobs go un-grabbed, society crumbles" - Abraham Lincoln (probably)<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: In the comic we are both un-wed and childless. I'm pretty sure no one wants a comic about my daughter flipping off micheal and saying "Suck it." Wait, that's actually pretty funny....<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: You're going to teach her that for the next time we meet, aren't you?<br /><br />
