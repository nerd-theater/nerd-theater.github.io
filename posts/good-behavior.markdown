<b>Alex</b>: I like the cell phone on the counter and in the mirror, your a genius. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm a master artist. I hate to do this Alex, but we need to have a grammar intervention for you: it's "you're" instead of "your" in places where "you are" is intended.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I am aware of that, when it is 6 in morning YOU try and care about grammar. Fag. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Grammar is there for all of us if we're just willing to accept it. It has a plan for you, Alex. Let us pray to grammar.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I hope you pray for a set of adult male genitals. Wait, you pray for that all the time. Rather, I hope you pray to HAVE a set of adult male genitals in the spot where your Ken Doll crotch is. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: All my Ken dolls were totally hung.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Do explain why Alex and you were just "hanging out" carrying shovels. The world wants to know!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Mostly for the gay sex. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Wait...all I remember is you saying "Here, take this roofie".<br /><br />
