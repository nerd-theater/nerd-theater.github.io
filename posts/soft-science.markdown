<b>rrittenhouse</b>: Sounds like the University of Phoenix<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That would be one hell of a resume: "I got my degree in Sociology from the University of Phoenix. Please don't throw this away."<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: First you give us no noses, then noses, and now you take them away? Why you gotta be hatin' on noses?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Who nose? :D<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Maybe Rallo is giving us insight into a world of which we know so little...I mean, African American culture cannot be all about grape soda and bitches that be hatin'. ... right?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Rallo definitely has some surprises left for us all. Did you know he dropped out of high school to pursue a career as pizza courier?<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: So... daring. So noble!<br /><br />
