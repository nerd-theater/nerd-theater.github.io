<b>Mike</b>: I would have made the rest of the cast, but I ran out of socks!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Why do you only have two socks, and how do you have a sock with boobs?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Oh man I can't wait for that one scene with where the awkward asperger's nerd doesn't understand awkward jew nerd or awkward ethnic nerd.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I can't stand every douche (nerds can be douches too) on this planet constantly talking about this crap show.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: but....aren't you talking about this show now too?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: And a constant laugh track. We musn't forget that<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: How else would we know what's funny?<br /><br />
<b>Seminonymous Asshole</b>: Now sell t shirts on thinkgeek!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: no. never.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: We could sell actual Big Bang Theory sock puppets.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Whoa! I get it now. This show sucks, that's what's wrong with it! Thank you, sock puppets! <br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Oh, and I've noticed that somebody, not gonna name names, but somebody hasn't been adding WTF links to his comic posts. Every time you make a WTF link, an angel gets its wings and flies to an angel without wings and gets it on with that angel. Since Nerd Theater supports sex, MAKE A GODDAMNED WTF LINK!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Haters gonna hate, yo.<br /><br />
