<b>Michelle</b>: Alex... what a creeper... wearing sunglasses at night.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Chicks dig sunglasses.  Remember The Matrix?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: If you were already hungover twice in a day, you would wear sunglasses also<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: The only other way I could think to distinguish Alex's and Alan's characters is by giving Alan some generous man-tits.  We're talking some slammary mammaries here.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Give me the shades and still give Alan man-boobs<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'll give Alan 24 hours to opt-out of the man-boobs...<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: There you go, bringing up "slammary mammaries," like always!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That does it!  Alan's getting some man-titties.  The kind that make you go "Would I?  No, of course not...well, maybe."<br /><br />
<b>Eric</b>: I couldn't resist reading it... and, by the way, in my book tonight, I read about a researcher named Albert Mammary.  I'm not kidding.  Ha!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm sure he was popular with the ladies.  You know, since the guys were constantly kicking his ass.<br /><br />
