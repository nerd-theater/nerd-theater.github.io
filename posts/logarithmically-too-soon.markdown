<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: ok, I am co-operator of this comic, and even I don't know WTF this comic is about.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Check the WTF link (bottom left or click the comic itself). Why do I always have to explain my genius to you fuckers?<br /><br />
<b>chris</b>: I laughed. Then I laughed at the explanation. Then I thought it was admirable that you chose the less offensive thing that happened last week for t=3.   <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I guess I decided to have a heart for once. Also, I think Nerd Theater should only be read by people with a Ph.D.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: So then...you shouldn't read it?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Ouch...just...ouch.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: What Mike, did you FORGET that you don't have a PHD yet?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I feel like I have one IN MY SOUL.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I was going to ask how you were going to continue on now that Amy Winehouse has gone to that big crack den in the sky...but don't think you're clever by covering up your pain and suffering with fart jokes like you always do. <br /><br />
<b>Amy Winehouse</b>: Remember, Mike: I'm never too far.<br /><br />
