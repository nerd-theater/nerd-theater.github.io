<b>Mike</b>: Man have I been there, thinking a couple of blonde dudes are gonna plow me and finding out I just get the shits. :(<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Nothing is as nice as a good poop.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Lorem ipsum showoff!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Though that might have been mike speaking for me, I have in fact talked about how not much is as good as a nice heavy poop. Like the kind where you are 10 pounds lighter. <br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: I can just imagine the following scenario: Mike's wife - "Michael! For the last time, dinner's ready!" Mike - "I'll be there in just a sec, honey, right after I'm done drawing these 'straining to take a giant dump' lines for my comic!"<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: That's eerily accurate...are you a witch?<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Only if I've turned you into a newt, once.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I got better...<br /><br />
