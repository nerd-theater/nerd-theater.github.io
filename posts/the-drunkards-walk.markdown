<b>Michelle</b>: Shoes, real legs and hands! Aside from your fancy vomit graphics, what's next? Dare I ask?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I'm confused, who is D?<br /><br />
<b>D</b>: Awesome, my life is complete and I can die happy.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Alex: Don't worry, "D" doesn't refer to who you might think.  It *may* refer to a near-by friend depending on what his lawyers tell me.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Only way to tell is to get them both to vomit and see who makes the better HUUURRK sound.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: What could make two people simultaneously vomit?<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Umm.... Ipecac? Duh, Becky!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: And who the f is "D"?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: He's the spring in my step / the sugar in my tea / he's my alpha, my omega / he's the one for me!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: The only person I know that you know has a name that begins with "D" rhymes with Man, Can and Plan.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: ... there should be an 'and' in there somewhere. I'll let you figure it out!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I cannot reveal his identity.  He's like Batman, except without an overly concerned butler.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Hey lay it off with Batman ! He is a good guy !<br /><br />
<b>Bharath</b>: Yes, we know it's always a guy that is your alpha and omega and all that Greek crap!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: D is no Batman!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Sure he is!  I've seen him battle many a villian like "The Gaussian Process" with his Matlab utility belt!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Batman, you sicken me.<br /><br />
