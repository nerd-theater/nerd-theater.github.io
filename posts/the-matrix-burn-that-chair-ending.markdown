<b>Michelle</b>: Why did Keanu die with his hand on his crotch?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I was wondering if someone would notice.  In this version of The Matrix, Neo dies during a visit to the Woman in the Red Dress...<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Herpes are real in the matrix. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: The body cannot live with a blistered, itchy crotch.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Poor Keanu... he didn't mean to hurt nobody!<br /><br />
<b>Keanu Reeves</b>: I deserve to die this way after The Lake House.<br /><br />
<b>Keanu Reeves</b>: My name is stupid, and I deserve to die before they make the sequels. <br /><br />

<b>A Plank of Wood</b>: I knew Keanu in college and I can still act circles around that dude.<br /><br />
<b>The other guy from Bill and Ted</b>: I'll do things for food, like, sexual things. <br /><br />
<b>Pauly Shore</b>: I'm all over that shit.  Here's a bagel: ( o )<br /><br />
