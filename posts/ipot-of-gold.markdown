<b>Dancinpete</b>: I have been wondering the same thing as Alex for years. Thank you for this comic, as it clears up so many previously unanswered questions.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Will no one defend me?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Those who would defend you are not old enough to view the wonders of Nerd Theater.<br /><br />
<b>zombie_batch</b>: Mike turned me on to Nighwish and their Dark Passion Play cd years ago and I still listen to it.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: VINDICATION!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: yea, zombie_batch backs you up and that's vindication. Ass.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: At least he has the courage to put in a name, much like some of us have the courage to enjoy Rent all 525,600 minutes of the year!<br /><br />
<b>zombie_batch</b>: Yeah, good job on the annonymous handle. Checkout MGMT, I just was introduced to them recently and find their Oracular Spectacular cd quite enjoyable: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9dSYgd5Elk<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I'm just too lazy to write in my name. Also, you two should play big spoon little spoon. <br /><br />
<b>zombie_batch</b>: Instead of looking up the definition of homosexual positions on Urban Dictionary, we could be playing TF2 or Portal 2 co-op, but nooooooo.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I still have not received Portal 2 from my friends for free. You guys suck.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: On a less homosexual note, has anyone here played Portal 2 yet? I'm wanting to know how it is.<br /><br />
<b>The Caek</b>: is a lie<br /><br />
<b>zombie_batch</b>: Portal 2 is good. Just found out its also $30 on amazon, today (sunday) anyway.<br /><br />
