<b>Alex</b>: Descartes? What a noob, everyone knows that Socrates "Self Sacrifice in name of beliefs" move is the game breaker<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: What if Thomas Aquinas uses his "Philosopher's Stone" attack to render Socrates immortal?  Using the famous man-mortal syllogism and modus tollens, we may also conclude that Immortal Socrates is no longer a man!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Yea, but having been rendered immortal he renders all subsequent philosophers irrelevent and becomes "The Godfather" of thought<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: But with his new found wisdom, does Immortal Socrates forfeit  the game to ascend towards a higher plane of thought or does he pwn some n00bz?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Dude, it's just a game. He pwns 400bz, duh. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Alan, this is where you'd pipe in with an insightful philosophical comment to demonstrate how smart you are.  I'm gonna have to dock you a few points for me having to explain it to you.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Nietzsche Nietzsche Nietzsche Nietzsche Nietzsche<br /><br />
<b>God</b>: Nietzsche is dead.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: No, God is dead. ... Or in the T.V. ... I can never remember which.<br /><br />
