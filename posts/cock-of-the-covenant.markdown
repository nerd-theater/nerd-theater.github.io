<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: This would have been a good burn, but puberty beard's parents were separated.  His dad enjoyed the torture.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Aw, c'mon! Why you gotta be so darn mean, Alex? Puberty Beard don't wanna hurt nobody!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: This is actually a funny comic because right after he wrote this, this very same thing actually happened, minus the fire and death.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Do you carry around a bowling ball in that backpack, for such an instance? There has to be something more practical, more lightweight.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Like maybe a smaller bowling ball?<br /><br />
