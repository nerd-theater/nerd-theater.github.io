<b>The Animalia kingdom</b>: The judgement day is upon you, humans!! Its like terminator only it's Terhuminator!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: This is perhaps the best thing ever! I love the little scratching post podium and the pink bow. ... Is the cat having a rage stroke in the second frame?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: She's channeling the cat devil.  His name's Mittens the Mischevious.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I'm looking at this webpage in Chrome, on UBUNTU!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Smell that?  It's FREEDOM, my friend.  Also, a little feces.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Maybe if you washed your underwear more than once every winter solstice, the feces smell would go away!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Thats where he gets his programming mojo<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: and a cheap coffee additive only legal in the Phillipines.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Thats also where he learned to love being a pool boy.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I cant see the comic on my phone. Also, this page sucks on my crappy phone.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: It's designed for manly phones like the Droid, not toy phones that you'd use to stone a homeless guy for funsies.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: You get me a droid and I will fuck the shit out of it<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm not sure there's an app for that...<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: I imagine an orchestra striking a minor chord during the second frame. P.S. I love the pink bow. <br /><br />
