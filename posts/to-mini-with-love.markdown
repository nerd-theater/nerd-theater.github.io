<b>DancinPete</b>: Dear Mikey. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you go through this difficult time. <br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: speak for your self. MAN UP AND BUY A NEW DAMN IPOD MIKE!<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Also, I feel the song from this montage would be perfect for this scenario: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8CeHIntlls , minus the Spanish.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: If it's not the Glee soundtrack or Celine Dion then Mike doesn't want to hear it.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Don't go, don't go, don't go...  :'(<br /><br />
<b>Dawg-in-law</b>: Then the Droid, now the iPod.. Mike, you seriously need to lay off that Hannah Montana shit. It's all because of that, I tell you... repeatedly...<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: The thought of the clicks fading away just tugs at my heart strings. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I was gonna listen to some sad songs to mourn, but...<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Mike can't go and replace Mini so easily. He won her for being a Super Nerd! Any other iPod will be like a dried husk of what was once true love.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Then sleep with Steve Jobs till he gives you a new iPod<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Steve says he already pays me in angry sex.<br /><br />

<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: NEVAH!!!!!<br /><br />
<b>Google</b>: Ask me about Asian DP bukkake creampie gangbang!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Of course Mini died. You buried her alive!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Do you not bury an old person once they start clicking?<br /><br />
