<b>Michelle</b>: I thought it was Natalie Portman's tits?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: If only!  Nope, I was given the promise of previously unseen tit action in a Leia/Jabba scene.  That promise was left...unfulfilled.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: It was probably the best stunt ever, right after showing the whole school a picture of Mike naked, posing in seductive ways for his girlfriend. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Pro-tip #1 for kids: encrypt all pictures that contain your junk.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Pro-tip #2 for kids: don't take pictures of your junk.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Pro-tip #Z for Mike: You cannot hide from me, you can only prolong the enevitable.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Will you...be gentle?<br /><br />
<b>Alex </b>: Pro-tip# Q2R: NO. <br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Then... what was all the fuss about Natalie Portman's tits?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: They're tits...and they're attached to Natalie Portman.  If that doesn't qualify for a fuss, I'm not sure what does.<br /><br />
