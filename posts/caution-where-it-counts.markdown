<b>Dancinpete</b>: Hey! I tried to go to nerdtheatre.com, but it says the url expired on the 23rd. What the F?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: why would you need a condom for a bj?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: With Alex, it never stops at a beej.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: if it gets to a beej, there's gonna be some fuckin going on. And when I fuck bitches, they stay fucked. Twice!<br /><br />
<b>DIL</b>: This is a perfectly normal comic. There is nothing unsanitary about a beej or a pizza on the crotch, besides, isn't that how you are supposed to enjoy a slice while drinking?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Amen, brother.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Man, This comic is about me and I'm still grossed out by you two. For real, grab a fucking paper towel or something.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: They would, but the paper towel dispenser was empty!<br /><br />
