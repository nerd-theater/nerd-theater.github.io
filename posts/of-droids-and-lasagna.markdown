<b>Alex</b>: Really? I'm garfield?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: And America is totally enamored with your shenanigans!<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I like lasagna, I guess?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: All half-mexicans love lasagna.  It's like a bunch of tacos gang-banged a giant noodle and finished up with some cheesy bukkake.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Wow, that is really....descriptive.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: *sigh*...we really need some fans.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Comments should be going to the Twitter feed as well now.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: You wouldn't know bukkake if it hit you in the face!<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Wait a second... a quick search has taught me that bukakke is not at all like baklava. GROSS, MICHAEL!<br /><br />
<b>Alan</b>: Alex can follow NT's twitter with that droid I guess... Mike and CNN are the only ones who still think twitter is cool<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: I wish that was my Droid, that would rock. Also, twitter is in, and very terribly relevent. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Twitter isn't anything new, as jihadists would often carve short messages to each other on the chests of infidels, but it has a pretty little bluebird as a logo!<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Eee! I didn't realize how adorable this particular comic was, because I was too distracted by the (gross) comments. I like how Pooky is wearing shades, and the screen is illuminated on Alex's face.   <br /><br />
