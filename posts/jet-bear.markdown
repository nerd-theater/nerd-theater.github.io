<b>Dancinpete</b>: I've said this before, and I'll say this again: Michael? What...the hell?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Jet Bear!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Wtf?<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: I think we deserve a WTF link.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Your wish is my command!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: This is the best comic on your site... reminds me of the old days of fullyramblomatic :D<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Thanks! I've had many requests for a new Jet Bear comic. Perhaps I'll do one where he teams up with Sylvia Plath to solve the mystery of the old mill.<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: You wouldn't dare.<br /><br />
