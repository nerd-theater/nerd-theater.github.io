<b>Michelle</b>: YES!!!! It's so lovely! So fantastic! ... I also love how the guy is still wearing socks.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I hear socks are good luck in surgery!  Also, I can't draw feet.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: People who have suffered through those 6/7, 7/8, and Algebra 1 math books would understand the hilarity behind something so random ... Not to mention: "Four cows went down the cow chute..."<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: My favorite part is the way the nurse's eyebrows go from slanty panic to curved calm after the explosion, as if to say "I'm just relieved this is no longer my problem." May those stupid books live on in infamy. "If Motawmbo and Renaynay both left for Timbuktu at the same time..."<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: @Emmet: All I can think of when I read your name is Clara from Back to the Future III yelling "Emmet!  Emmet!" from the train at Doc.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: You should ask Emmet about her MIDDLE NAME!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: ...Jones?<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: Confession: I've never seen BTHF I, II, or III. I am a pop culture failure. And YOU! @ Michelle. I'll deal with YOU later! How dare you... <br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: PS, the next time I fill out a job application, I am doing so as Emmet Jones.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Of all of the names, you thought of "Jones"???!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyrZkw8KQHY<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Hmm... I don't remember this from the movie...<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Sure, it was right after Marty found out he got Space AIDS from the future where he and Doc trained that chimp to drive the Dolorean while they were both transmogrified into puppets.<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGlrobvb-ao<br /><br />
<b>That '70s show</b>: Is Emmet's middle name Beulah ?<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I think it's Gargamel...<br /><br />
<b>Michelle</b>: Your MOM'S name is Gargamel!<br /><br />
