<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: ha!<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I thought everything was called poopies in India?<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Fix her hands Mike, that shit is gonna bug the hell out of me.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Whoops, fixed.<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Your Mom is poopies!<br /><br />
<b>Dancinpete</b>: Oh my god... this is hilarious! <br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: @DP, yes, this is Mikes funniest work. Listen, I read the scripts, I get access to the shit he's working on. This comic is the high tide of Nerd Theater.@ AA, MY MOM HAS A CONDITION ASS HOLE!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Is "Condition Ass Hole" like "Code Red"? I guess it would be more closely related to "Code Brown". Or, in your mom's case, "Code I-Have-No-Anal-Lining-Left"<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Yea, she should have gotten that anal wall reinforcement like your mom did. Fag.<br /><br />
