<b>Alex</b>: That's why he moved to Africa. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I thought he moved there to search for Pythagoras' long lost gold. And nail some foxy chicks.<br /><br />
<b>Emmet</b>: Wait. WAIT! Why don't they have noses?!<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: DAMN! Give a mouse a neck and he asks for a nose...<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: I hope to god he doesn't nail anything or anyone in Africa. He'll get the AIDS. <br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: Are you sure arms can bend like that? I mean, have you ever asked one of your buddies to bend his arms to compare? Do people really hold bananas like that? <br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: By the way, I don't care how "yesterday" Harry Potter jokes are, there is never NOT a time to make fun of that pansy-assed butt nugget.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: I'm not sure how YOU hold a banana, but I've had plenty of positive feedback on my technique! Also, Harry Potter should have magicked himself a pair and nailed Hermione.<br /><br />
<b>Alex</b>: Hermoine was Rons, Harry nailed Rons sister, which I guess isn't a burn in England, or when your sister is a kinda dumpy ginger. <br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Fuck Ron. Hermione totally settled for the zero when she would've had the hero. Harry could have totally had a witch harem. Now THAT'S a book I would read.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: So... if the apple is being tossed into the air, and the banana is being clutched... where on earth did the orange end up?<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: out of frame, duh.<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: "Our of frame?"... Stating the obvious: plus 10; Lack of cleverness: minus eleventy billion<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: The cops totally busted his orange after he said he just needed to juice one last time!<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: And I realize I misspelled "Out," but only because my eyes were blinded by the tears from the lack of cleverness.  And thank you, Michael, for being gross! Don't change, ever! Although a shower every now and then couldn't hurt...<br /><br />
<b>Anonymous Asshole</b>: Cleverness is like a doughnut, there's always a hole someone is gonna bitch about.<br /><br />
<b>Mike</b>: Funny, your face is often like a donut. Hey-o!<br /><br />
<b>DancinPete</b>: ... Why bitch about the hole? You still get a doughnut out of the deal!<br /><br />
