<h2>Interview with Tarn Adams (July 21st, 2010)</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  Nerd Theater has had a number of interviews with 17th century celebrities and
  creatures of mythology over the years, but this marks our first interview
  that didn't require dangerous amounts of methamphetamine and/or a Ouija
  board!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Tarn Adams</b> and his brother Zach created and continue to update the epic
  game <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> from Bay
  12 Games. Alex invited Tarn to the Nerd Theater International Headquarters
  (currently occupied by several cats and a hamper) for the opportunity of a
  lifetime. After learning that Tarn is, in fact, <a
  href="../assets/img/tarn_cat.jpg">not a dwarf</a>, it was decided that an e-mail
  interview would take place rather than a 72-hour reenactment of Alex's
  favorite Dwarf Fortress game in full costume and make-up.
</p>
<!-- <p>
  We're not sure if this constitutes an <em>exclusive</em> interview as we
  never established with Tarn that we wouldn't see other interviewees and he
  clearly has been <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/links.html">with
  other interviewers</a>. Still, a girl can dream that she's the only one,
  right?  <b>Right?</b>
</p> -->

<h3>The Interview</h3>

<!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">First, the big question that I'm pretty sure is obligatory:
  where are you at in the DF development? I don't have any specifics, just
  anything you'd like to say about where the project is in terms of bugs,
  features so on and so forth.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">I'm currently cleaning up a mess of bugs that accumulated
  during the 19 month dry spell.  We're slowly switching gears over to new
  developments now, which'll involve making adventure mode into a game, in
  part.  We'll have to see how that turns out.  I'm pretty excited about the
  possibilities.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
   <span class="alex">I have seen a quote that says DF uses as much processing
   power as a modern 3D game. Is this something that you are trying to fix or
   plan to fix? Some people might be put off by an ASCII game that eats up the
   same kind of power as Call of Duty. Is that something you think about in
   terms of marketing the game as it gets closer to a commercial release?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
   <span class="tarn">It's a mix of something to fix and something that comes
   out of the simulation.  DF isn't doing the same things as Call of Duty, and
   Call of Duty isn't doing the same things as DF -- I'm sure their people are
   more competent than I am, which is where the fixing comes in, but there will
   always remain the key point that as many items/dwarves/map tiles as you
   have, you can add more, until your computer maxes out some resource.  The
   game will always be able to stretch a computer as far as it can be stretched
   (at least a 32 bit OS, he he he).  Even a simple game with some scaling
   quantity can do that, though, so the processing power requirement can come
   up anywhere.  I imagine more professional people would limit the game to
   fewer dwarves and smaller maps, to the point that the computer could always
   run it smoothly, once they had done their best, in order to hide the
   remaining limitations and defects, but I've tended to let that stuff float.
   My default horizontal map size has been creeping smaller as it gets deeper
   in height, anyway.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 3 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">That leads me to my next question: do you have plans
  concerning DF as a commercial product? Have you thought about programs like
  Steam, Xbox LIVE Marketplace, or Greenhouse games to distribute it? Pricing is
  something that is a big issue today with games like Farmville raking in the
  money one dollar at a time, and major console releases regularly charge $60.00
  and up. I know some people would gladly pay full price for a game like DF,
  while some might be turned off by a text-based game at any price.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">There are no plans to release DF in any way other than the
  way it is currently being released.  Ultimately, I think that is probably
  losing us a lot of money, but there are a couple of things -- first, the game
  is rough around the edges and is in ongoing development, and second, I just
  personally don't want to sell things.  I think there are a few games that
  sell "check out the daily developments" licenses or something, so I guess
  that model can work out.  That leaves me with one reason, I suppose.  If DF
  continues to attract interest at the current levels, that'll be fine, since
  we are doing all right.  I'm not really sure what would end up happening if
  it dries up.  It seems inevitable, and I wouldn't rule out selling some other
  games at that point or something.  Giving away games is a matter of
  preference and convenience for me, and I'm able to do it that way right
  now.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">I've read that you started with Basic and picked up C as
  you got older. C++ has a quite a few issues, but it's the de-facto language
  for any serious game development. How do you feel about C++ as a game
  development platform?  Do you feel that it's the only language that is able to
  handle DF? I know that C# is a powerful language and <a
  href="http://www.mono-project.com">open source</a>. Have you ever thought
  about translating DF to a different platform or, at this point, would it be
  inconceivable to port?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">I can't really comment, since I have little experience
  outside of C/C++ now.  I don't even remember much BASIC.  I'm sure other
  languages could handle DF.  I have no reason to move DF to some other
  language, or rather, there might be some compelling reason, but it wouldn't
  outweigh my lack of experience and the likely considerable amount of time
  needed to get the job done.  The only reason it would happen is if way down
  the line, C++ is no longer supported by whatever weird 4D spaceship operating
  systems we are running in our thermo-regulated pollution pods.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 5 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Heres one just for the programmer crowd: Do you use an IDE
  or just a text editor and compiler? If you use a text editor, I have to ask:
  Vim or Emacs?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">I'm on MSVC Express.  I'm not sure which one, since it
  keeps changing.  2008 maybe, with 2010 or whatever they are on now
  upcomingish.  I'm comfortable with the debugger.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 6 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">How was learning C++ for you? I am at least halfway
  competent in Python and C++ makes my head spin. I'm pretty sure you smarter
  then me anyway, but was it difficult to learn C++?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">Learning the basics wasn't so bad, although my shit is
  trash, so I wouldn't want to say I've accomplished anything at all.  I don't
  think there's a single part of DF where a CS guy would look at it and go "ah,
  yes, that's elegant", at least among the parts written by me.  I'm good with
  learning and abstractions and that sort of thing, so I'm not usually confused
  by the things I have to pick up, but I'm generally writing the games too
  impatiently to go back and study techniques with an appreciation for
  programming as its own deal or to mindfully construct some algorithm that
  handles a situation cleverly, and programming isn't something I enjoy for its
  own sake.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 7 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Your game shares a lot in common with some of the open
  source games out there today, but as far as I can tell, it's not an open
  source project; you are making a game by yourself. In another interview, I
  read that you worry about control of the project. Is this why DF is not an
  open source project or was it a decision right from the start that this would
  be your project alone? Its quite a task to make a game like DF largely by
  yourself, and I know you have help, but have you ever thought about opening up
  parts of the game?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">DF is partially open source (under a BSD-style license) --
  the SDL stuff written by Baughn and B. Helyer and others is available with
  the Linux version, and that includes the display, input and audio code.
  They've contributed a significant amount of material, and it is usable by
  anyone.  The rest is closed.  It's simply a matter of financial security.  I
  have absolutely no idea how we would fare if the game were open source, and
  it's not a risk I'm willing to take lightly.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 8 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Here's one I've wanted to ask a developer like you: is it
  just me or are modern games crap? I know you don't make time for Halo or other
  modern popular games, but are you aware of them at all?  Do you think that the
  loss of learning curves and the simplification of games is making our culture
  diluted now that mom and dad can play games?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">I'm not inclined to play many of the games produced by
  large studios, but it's not like I like all of the independent games, since
  many of them are just as derivative or uninteresting.  There are lots of good
  games though.  Over the last...  I don't know, I've gotten a chance to play
  some of the modern console games.  Some of them were fun.  None of them drew
  me in like my very favorite computer games, but between like and dislike, I
  liked some of them.  I've had fun with some independent games as well.
  Looking at the overall sweep of things, compared to, say, the mid to late 80s
  and early 90s on the PC, well, it's hard to compare...  there are a ton of
  games available these days, and lots of them are neat.  There are lots of
  ideas being tried, and even if there are lots of cynical games that don't
  bring anything new to the table, you can find all kinds of things, more so
  than at any other time, as far as I remember.  At the same time, I feel like
  the pace of innovation back when I was growing up extrapolated to an arc of
  development in game complexity and procedural generation and what have you
  that should have led to games which made the best parts of DF obsolete ten
  years ago, and I can't help but feel disappointed.  My brother and I are
  making games in part because nobody ever made our dream games.  It might be
  like that for lots of people that write them.  Well, we've been making them
  practically as long as we've been playing them, but the lack of games was
  certainly a driving force, especially starting with the early/mid 90s and
  onward.  It's pretty blurry by now though, he he he.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 9 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Since you've said that you don't play the pop games, do you
  keep up with any of the other indy games out there (that seem to keep eating
  all my time)? In particular have you taken a look at <a
  href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>, another game Three Panel Soul gave
  some attention to?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">
    I haven't played Minecraft, though it has a thread on my forum and people
    really enjoy it there.  I think my not jumping in probably has to do with
    the social aspect.  Or did it have a single player mode?  I don't recall.
    The developer mentioned adding a DF level importer for it.  I don't know if
    he actually did that or not.  It does make me feel a little weird to play a
    game which he said was partially DF-inspired.  I'm not sure why.
  </span>
  <p class="tarn">
    As for other independent games, I played a bunch of games for the IGF,
    which was a lot of fun (Star Guard, Miegakure, Cogs, I remember off the top
    of my head)...  a bunch of flash games...  Spelunky and Aquaria...  what
    else have I played recently...  Solium Infernum...  Among the
    non-independent ones...  the Katauri Interactive King's Bounty games were
    fun...  Demons' Souls was entertaining for a while...  I had never played
    any of the 3D platformers, so playing Super Mario Galaxy was fun.
  </p>
  <p class="tarn">
    I'm back to nothing now.  Elemental should be a game I enjoy, but I have no
    idea how it'll be or if I'm going to get it.  It'll depend on what I hear.
    I liked Shadow of the Colossus and Ico, so I'm also waiting for the Last
    Guardian, but I was also sort of torn on both of those in the end, since
    they are linear and puzzley, but the overall experience still recommends
    them highly.

<!-- Question 10 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Right now we are seeing large developers swallow up
  everyone, including smaller indy developers. Have you gotten any interest from
  a major publisher, or even the aforementioned Steam or Greenhouse
  Games?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">Yeah, we've been approached with different ideas.  Nothing
  has come of it, and I think our overall situation is such that nothing
  probably ever will.  It would take a deal which is insanely bad for them to
  make it worth our while, and vice versa, as far as I can tell.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 11 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">How did you feel about Three Panel Soul "exposing" your
  game to people like me? I imagine they must have sent quite a few people to
  your game. Was that a good thing or did it make your servers more expensive to
  maintain?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">We've had growing pains with server crashes and server
  moves and dying forums and whatever else, but it's all good.  The more people
  that play the game the better.  The increase in donations tends to more than
  cover the expenses, though we're still a very small operation, even among
  independent games that are "making it", as far as I can tell, so I'm sure
  there are lots of scaling effects I haven't experienced.</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<hr class="end" />

<!-- Question 12 -->
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_alex_75.png" alt="Alex" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">I've seen so much positive press when I google Dwarf
  Fortress. Has anyone ever actually published something negative about your
  game? Any really good quotes your remember?</span>
</div>
<br style="clear: both;" />
<div class="col-image">
  <img src="../assets/img/profile_tarn_adams_75.png" alt="Tarn Adams" />
</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">Ha ha, even the most positive articles will have something
  in there about how the interface sucks or that the game "isn't for everyone".
  I've seen negative blogs but I don't remember any "official" negative
  articles.  That could just be the nature of our release process though.
  Dwarf Fortress doesn't get a lot of full-fledged reviews, partially because
  it isn't really billed or released as a complete game and so it resists that
  kind of final-seeming judgment with a score and all that.  Publications that
  don't care about it just ignore it.  People that are pulling for the game to
  stick around tend to talk about it and even fight hard in some cases to get a
  piece in about it.  There could also be a higher frequency of DF-inclined
  people in game journalism in general than the overall population of video
  game players, since they play a lot of games and DF isn't user friendly.  In
  any case, if we tried to sell Dwarf Fortress, and it had a one-off release
  online and/or in a box somewhere that we somehow magically financed, and it
  was high profile enough to receive typical press treatment, I'm sure there
  would be a ton of negative reviews.  It's a very unpolished game that doesn't
  appeal to very many people.  That's not to say I don't like it, he he he --
  it's just a niche game.</span>

<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">I just have to ask: do you play in ASCII mode or do you use

<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">I play with ASCII, yeah.  I've been with that for 8 years
  now, so it's hard for me to consider what I'd want to be on ideally, if I
  could choose anything.  If a similar game came along with completely
  different graphics, I wouldn't insist on playing it in ASCII if there were
  some buried option to do so.  I usually stick with defaults in that
  department, whatever the game.  I change difficulty settings, but I hardly
  ever look for mods.</span>

<div class="col-text">
  <span class="alex">Do you use Linux or Windows? I assume Windows, for some

  <span class="alex">You mentioned the limit of a 32-bit OS. Does DF use the

</div>
<div class="col-text">
  <span class="tarn">There's a graphics thread in the SDL version, but yeah, it
  only uses the CPU power of one processor in general, which is another
  limitation.  The limit regarding 32/64 bit is that DF is compiled for 32 bit
  operating systems, so it can only address so much memory.  There will be
  growing pains there, but it should be more easily upgradable than the

  will probably use you in a comic to explain why our god-awful web page got an
  interview? I promise, we will only embarrass our characters. You'll play the
  Dean Martin to our Jerry Lewis.</span>

  offensive comic you want and no one has to know.</span>

  to write some of the ASCII Art rewards for the donors, but it'd mostly just
  be about dwarves stealing each other's booze or mindless violence involving
  vermin in the mushroom fields.  Zach does much more epic rewards.</span>
